# JAVA-JOURNEY
📘 JAVA-JOURNEY
Description:
This repository highlights my journey of learning Java—from understanding core concepts to exploring GUI with AWT and Swing, diving into multithreading, JDBC, collections, and building mini-projects. It's a personal collection of practice programs, project experiments, debugging efforts, and hands-on learning based on Abdul Bari Sir’s Java Course, Let Us Java by Yashwant Kanetkar, and various other resources.

Though these may not be perfect or production-ready, every folder reflects my dedication, curiosity, and genuine love for coding.

🧠 What I Learned:
Java basics: loops, functions, arrays, classes, objects

OOP concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

Java GUI programming with AWT and Swing

Working with threads and handling concurrency

Collections API like ArrayList, HashMap, Set

JDBC for basic database interaction

Building mini-projects from scratch

Debugging, tracing errors, and improving code step-by-step

🚀 Why This Repo?
Because learning isn't about perfection—it's about progress.

This repo is:

📘 A reflection of my learning efforts

🔍 A tool for revision and reference

💡 A small motivation for anyone starting their Java journey
